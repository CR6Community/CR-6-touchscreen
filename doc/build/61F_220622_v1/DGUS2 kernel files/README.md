# NOTE: These kernel files are not required, unless you are having problems resulting from having inadvertently overwritten the DGUS2 kernel for which your display was last calibrated.

## STEP1 - BEFORE ACTING ON ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Create an EMPTY folder at the root directory of an EMPTY micro SD card.
2. Ensure that your printer power is OFF
3. Place that SD card in your display and cycle power ON
4. The top line of the display will report which version of DGUS2 is currently flashed .  
4. Make note of which DGUS version is currently flashed to your display hardware (see top line on display)
5. Take care to follow the applicable instructions below.

## IF your display is currently running v3.5 and it should be running v4.5:
STEP 2: 
1. Copy T5L_UI_DGUS2_V45_20220105.BIN to the DWIN_SET folder created at step 1 above, and flash that to your display.
2. Verify that the top line on the blue flash screen is now overwritten in red confirming that DGUS2 v4.5 is flashed
3. Optionally repeat step 1 with an empty DWIN_SET folder, to confirm v4.5 is now the DGUS2 OS

# OR

## IF your display is currently running v4.5 and it should be running v3.5:
STEP 2: 
1. Copy T5L_UI_DGUS2_V35_20200730.BIN to the DWIN_SET folder created at step 1 above, and flash that to your display.
2. Verify that the top line on the blue flash screen is now overwritten in red confirming that DGUS2 v3.5 is flashed
3. Optionally repeat step 1 with an empty DWIN_SET folder, to confirm v3.5 is now the DGUS2 OS


# Here is how to interpret what you see:

The top line of the blue boot screen always identifies the current DGUS2 OS in white text.

If the DWIN_SET folder being flashed contains a DGUS kernel BIN file, the top line is overwritten in RED text, reporting the new version that has just been flashed.

If the two lines are different, it may be difficult to read either line.

If the two lines are identical, the current DWIN_SET folder has reflashed the same kernel to the display.
