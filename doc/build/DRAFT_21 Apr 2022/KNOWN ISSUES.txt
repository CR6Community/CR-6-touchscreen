The following issues have been observed but not resolved, at this DRAFT release:

1. Upon completion of Filament Load or Unload:
 - the final message confirming that the process has completed:
    - IS NOT displayed on that control screen
    - IS displayed in a tiny font on every other page to which you navigate, until an action causes a new message to replace it. That new message will be the correct font size again.

2. The two buttons at the top of the Prepare menu (LED and Sound) are meant to have ON/OFF icons that confirm the currently commanded state of those controls.  Neither ICON is appearing.

3. The elapsed print time display is fully-justified within the text field, so it appears stretched-out on the screen.  Still trying to figure out why, so I can fix it.

IF you are able to help solve any of these issues, please message @Thinkersbluff with the key info.  TIA!
