The following issues have been observed but not resolved, at this DRAFT release:

1. Upon completion of Filament Load or Unload, the message confirming that the process has completed IS NOT displayed. The M117 Scrolling Text message space is instead just blank.  Further testing has confirmed that messages longer than 28 characters will not be displayed, until this problem has been debugged and corrected.

2. The ABLprocess no longer uses the contents of 35_Autolevel.icl to animate the collection & display of the mesh data.  To enable old eyes to read the mesh, the normally white background of the initial screen has been changed to black.  As a result, when the process first initializes all of the values to 0.000 in white, those zeroes are now visible to the user. This will not look familiar to past users of 6.1, but should not be a problem for new users.

IF you are able to help solve any of these issues, please message @Thinkersbluff with the key info.  TIA!
