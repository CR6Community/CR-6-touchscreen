The following issues have been observed but not resolved, at this DRAFT release:

1. Upon completion of Filament Load or Unload:
 - the final message confirming that the process has completed IS NOT displayed

2. The two buttons at the top of the Prepare menu (LED and Sound) are meant to have ON/OFF icons that confirm the currently commanded state of those controls.  Neither ICON is appearing. Both buttons work, though.

3. The LED ON/OFF button on the Printing->Tune screen is not appearing. The button does control the LED, though.

IF you are able to help solve any of these issues, please message @Thinkersbluff with the key info.  TIA!
