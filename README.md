# CR-6 Touchscreen software
Attempt to extend the CR-6 touch screen software. You need the [DGUS v8.0.x software](http://dwin.com.cn/home/Index/download_file?download_id=4796) for that.

You can open the .dgus project file in the `src` folder:

![DGUS II interface](doc/dgus2util.png)

## Other documentation

Vendor documentation is mirrored to the [doc/vendor](doc/vendor) folder.

In addition, [this is a nice resource](https://github.com/rubienr/MarlinDgusResources/tree/creality-ender-5-plus/projects).
