# CR-6 Touchscreen software
Attempt to extend the CR-6 touch screen software to operate with newer display hardware being sold with CR6 machines as of approximately Dec 2021.
This repository belongs to Thinkersbluff and is forked from [the CR6Community Touchscreen Firmware repository](https://github.com/CR6Community/CR-6-touchscreen).

## Downloads

This project is not yet ready to release a stable version of the updated display firmware.
If you wish to experiment with what Thinkersbluff has achieved to-date, you will find the files under [doc/build](https://github.com/Thinkersbluff/CR-6-touchscreen_Thinkersbluff_Fork/tree/feat/dwin-nextgen-support/doc/build) in this repository.

*If you have [a BTT SKR board with the BTT TFT](https://damsteen.nl/blog/2020/11/25/how-to-btt-skr-cr6-installation) you do not need this firmware. This firmware is only for when you use the stock Creality LCD with the stock or BTT motherboard.*
